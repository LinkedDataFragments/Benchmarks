# LDOW2014 Linked Data Fragments Benchmarks
These queries can be used to benchmark the performance
of a Basic Linked Data Fragments client/server setup.
The results have been described in our paper
on the 7<sup>th</sup> workshop on Linked Data on the Web workshop (LDOW2014):
“[Web-Scale Querying through Linked Data Fragments](http://linkeddatafragments.org/publications/ldow2014.pdf)”.

`queries/dbpedia-generated-queries.log` contains SPARQL queries against DBpedia.

The `scripts` folder contains the scripts used to generate them.
